libglib-testing
===============

libglib-testing is a test library providing test harnesses and mock classes
which complement the classes provided by GLib. It is intended to be used by
any project which uses GLib and which wants to write internal unit tests.

libglib-testing is a separate project from GLib itself for two reasons:
 • To allow unstable API to be prototyped before being stabilised.
 • To keep test harness API out of libglib, since it should only be needed
   at test time, not at runtime.

All the library APIs are currently unstable and are likely to change wildly.
